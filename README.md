# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Bookbot takes a plaintext file and prints the character count to the console.

## Usage
1. Clone repo with `git clone https://github.com/scottyloveless/bookbot` in your desired root folder.
2. Run the command `python3 main.py <book_path>` where book_path is the location of your txt file.
